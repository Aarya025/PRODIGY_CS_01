Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption

Understanding Cryptography Basics: Diving into the Caesar Cipher helped me grasp the fundamentals of classical encryption techniques. I learned how substitution ciphers work and why they are an important stepping stone in cryptography.
Python Coding Skills: This task strengthened my understanding of string manipulation and user input handling in Python. It also gave me the chance to write efficient and readable code.
Logical Thinking & Problem-Solving: Implementing the algorithm involved thinking through how to handle edge cases, such as shifts that wrap around the alphabet and handling different character types.
Practical Application: Beyond just coding, I learned how encryption algorithms can be implemented in real-world applications, whether for data protection or secure communication.
